DWDSmor implements the lemmatisation and morphological analysis of
word forms as well as the generation of paradigms of lexical words in
written German.

## Usage

DWDSmor is available via PyPI:

``` plaintext
pip install dwdsmor
```

For lemmatisation:

``` python-console
>>> import dwsdmor
>>> lemmatizer = dwdsmor.lemmatizer()
>>> assert lemmatizer("getestet", pos={"+V"}) == "testen"
>>> assert lemmatizer("getestet", pos={"+ADJ"}) == "getestet"
```

…

## Development

This repository provides source code for building DWDSmor lexica and transducers
as well as for using DWDSmor transducers for morphological analysis and paradigm
generation:

* `dwdsmor/` contains Python packages for using DWDSmor, including
  scripts for morphological analysis and for paradigm generation by
  means of DWDSmor transducers.
* `share/` contains XSLT stylesheets for extracting lexical entries in SMORLemma
  format from XML sources of DWDS articles.
* `lexicon/dwds/` contains scripts for building DWDSmor lexica by means of the
  XSLT stylesheets in `share/` and DWDS sources in `lexicon/dwds/wb/`, which are
  not part of this repository.
* `lexicon/sample/` contains scripts for building sample DWDSmor lexica by means
  of the XSLT stylesheets in `share/` and the sample lexicon in
  `lexicon/sample/wb/`.
* `grammar/` contains an FST grammar derived from SMORLemma, providing the
  morphology for building DWDSmor automata from DWDSmor lexica.
* `test/` implements a test suite for the DWDSmor transducers.

DWDSmor is in active development. In its current stage, DWDSmor supports most
inflection classes and some productive word-formation patterns of written
German. Note that the sample lexicon in `lexicon/sample/wb/` only covers a
sketchy subset of the German vocabulary, and so do the DWDSmor automata compiled
from it.


## Prerequisites

[GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)
: Development, builds and tests of DWDSmor are performed
  on [Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org/). While other UNIX-like operating
  systems such as MacOS should work, too, they are not actively supported.

[Python >= v3.9](https://www.python.org/)
: DWDSmor targets Python as its primary runtime environment. The DWDSmor
  transducers can be used via SFST's commandline tools, queried in Python
  applications via language-specific
  [bindings](https://github.com/gremid/sfst-transduce), or used by the Python
  scripts `dwdsmor.py` and `paradigm.py` for morphological analysis and for
  paradigm generation.

[Saxon-HE](https://www.saxonica.com/)
: The extraction of lexical entries from XML sources of DWDS articles is
  implemented in XSLT 2, for which Saxon-HE is used as the runtime environment.

[Java (JDK) >= v8](https://openjdk.java.net/)
:  Saxon requires a Java runtime.

[SFST](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/)
: a C++ library and toolbox for finite-state transducers (FSTs); please take a
  look at its homepage for installation and usage instructions.

On a Debian-based distribution, install the following packages:

```sh
apt install python3 default-jdk libsaxonhe-java sfst
```

Set up a virtual environment for project builds, for example via Python's `venv`:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then run the DWDSmor setup routine in order to install Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```


## Building DWDSmor lexica and transducers

For building DWDSmor lexica and transducers, run:

```sh
make all
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```sh
make dwds && make dwds-install && make dwdsmor
```

Note that these commands require DWDS sources in `lexicon/dwds/wb/`, which are
not part of this repository.

Alternatively, you can build sample DWDSmor lexica and transducers from the
sample lexicon in `lexicon/sample/wb/` by running:

```sh
make sample && make sample-install && make dwdsmor
```

After building DWDSmor transducers, install them into `lib/`, where the
Python scripts `dwdsmor` and `dwdsmor-paradigm` expect them by default:

```sh
make install
```

The installed DWDSmor transducers are:

* `lib/dwdsmor.{a,ca}`: transducer with inflection and word-formation
  components, for lemmatisation and morphological analysis of word forms in
  terms of grammatical categories
* `lib/dwdsmor-morph.{a,ca}`: transducer with inflection and word-formation
  components, for the generation of morphologically segmented word forms
* `lib/dwdsmor-finite.{a,ca}`: transducer with an inflection component and a
  finite word-formation component, for testing purposes
* `lib/dwdsmor-root.{a,ca}`: transducer with inflection and word-formation
  components, for lexical analysis of word forms in terms of root lemmas (i.e.,
  lemmas of ultimate word-formation bases), word-formation process,
  word-formation means, and grammatical categories in term of the
  Pattern-and-Restriction Theory of word formation (Nolda 2022)
* `lib/dwdsmor-index.{a,ca}`: transducer with an inflection component only with
  DWDS homographic lemma indices, for paradigm generation


## Testing DWDSmor

Run

    pytest

in order to test basic transducer usage and for potential regressions.

## Contact

Feel free to contact [Andreas Nolda](mailto:andreas.nolda@bbaw.de) for
questions regarding the lexicon or the grammar and
[Gregor Middell](mailto:gregor.middell@bbaw.de) for question related
to the integration of DWDSmor into your corpus-annotation pipeline.

## Credits

DWSDmor is based on the following software and datasets:

1. [SFST](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/), a C++ library
   and toolbox for finite-state transducers (FSTs) (Schmidt 2006)
2. [SMORLemma](https://github.com/rsennrich/SMORLemma) (Sennrich and Kunz 2014),
   a modified version of the Stuttgart Morphology
   ([SMOR](https://www.cis.lmu.de/~schmid/tools/SMOR/)) (Schmid, Fitschen, and
   Heid 2004) with an alternative lemmatisation component
3. the [DWDS dictionary](https://www.dwds.de/) (BBAW n.d.) replacing the
   [IMSLex](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/lexika/imslex/)
   (Fitschen 2004) as the lexical data source for German words, their grammatical
   categories, and their morphological properties.
